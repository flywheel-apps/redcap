# This describes where we will find the correct REDCAP
# "record ID" for metadata at the subject level
record:

  # First we indicate what the redcap record ID label is:
  # In this case the label is "rc_subid" in redcap.
  rc_key: rc_subid

  # Now we indicate where the VALUE of this redcap record ID is
  # within flywheel:
  fw_key: info.REDCapID

  # Finally we must know which container this fw_key is on:
  container_level: subject

  # Together, these commands mean that by including they key/value
  # pair: {'rc_subid': subject.label}, we can tell REDCap which 
  # Record we will be updating.

# This is the meat of the mapping.  It specifies which 
# redcap metadata to import.
fields: 

  # This means the RC items listed here will be copied over to each subject
